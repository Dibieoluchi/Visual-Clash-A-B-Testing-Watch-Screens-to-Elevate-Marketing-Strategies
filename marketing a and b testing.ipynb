    "Visual Clash: A/B Testing Watch Screens to Elevate Marketing Strategies\n",
    "The watch company 'Timetrends' is conducting a study to boost its sales by investigating changes to the watch screen design. Two types of campaigns have been set up: a control campaign using the existing watch screen design (Design A) and a test campaign incorporating a slightly different design with a different CTA at the bottom of the page. Instead of a complete redesign, the best practice is to make targeted changes to specific parts of the screen to see how these adjustments impact profit and engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "Campaign Name: Identifies each advertising campaign in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Date: Records the date of each entry, providing a temporal dimension to the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spend: Reflects the amount invested in each campaign in dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "Impressions and Reach: Measure the visibility and unique impressions achieved by the ads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Website Clicks, Searches, View Content, Add to Cart, Purchase: User interactions captured during the campaigns, providing insights into engagement and conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis: Our project hinges on a clear hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Null Hypothesis (H0): The new watch screen design does not yield a significant improvement in marketing campaign performance, measured by user engagement and sales metrics, compared to the existing design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The new watch screen design outperforms the existing design, resulting in a notable enhancement of user engagement and sales metrics in marketing campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):\n",
    "\n",
    "In selecting KPIs for this test, high-level metrics are prioritized to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of campaign success. The primary KPI should be a measure of profitability, such as ROI, to reflect the overall impact of the campaign. While CTR is also an important metric, it should serve as a secondary KPI. If the test design yields a higher CTR but does not improve ROI, it may not be worth implementing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary KPI:\n",
    "\n",
    "Return on Investment (ROI): This metric reflects the profitability of the campaign and should be the main focus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondary KPIs:\n",
    "\n",
    "Click-Through Rate (CTR): Percentage of impressions that resulted in a click.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversion Rate: Percentage of clicks that resulted in a purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your company has tasked you with determining which watch screen design changes work better for boosting sales and engagement. To achieve this, an A/B test will be conducted. Your job is to be the data detective, analyzing the numbers and providing a clear verdict on which watch screen design is the superior choice. Your findings will guide future decisions on how Timetrends showcases its watches to the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Get ready to dig into the data and let the company know which watch screen design is the real superstar for our ads. Your analysis will shape the path for our marketing strategies moving forward."

    "Understanding p-values in Statistical Testing\n",
    "In statistical hypothesis testing, the p-value is a measure of the evidence against a null hypothesis. A small p-value (typically ≤ 0.05) suggests strong evidence against the null hypothesis, leading to its rejection. Conversely, a larger p-value suggests weak evidence against the null hypothesis."
